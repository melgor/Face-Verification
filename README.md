# Face-Verification
Framework for Face-Verification

The aim of the framework is to detect and classify face from images.
It is based on Computer Vision technology for Face Detection and Deep Learning for Face Verification.

Steps of framework:
  1. Detect face: Done
  2. Face Frontalization: Done
  3. Face Verification: Done
  
config.ini is example configuration file, need to run program

Dependies:
  - dlib (face detection and detection of facial points)
  - parseYAML (parse model for face frontalization, TODO: remove this dependence)
  - opencv (main library used for Computer Vision)
  - boost (used for parser of command line, config file, file system)
  - liblinear (for verification purpose, TODO: remove, not needed any longer)
