========================================================================


1. About
This program is the inotify C++ interface. It is designed for easy use
of Linux inotify technology in C++ applications. You need not to deal
with file descriptors and such uncomfortable things. Instead you can
use a few simple C++ classes.


2. Requirements
* Linux kernel 2.6.13 or later (with inotify compiled in)
* inotify header(s) installed in <INCLUDE_DIR>/sys. The most common
  place is /usr/include/sys. Some Linux distributions contain only
  inotify.h which defines everything needed. But sometimes must
  be used inotify.h and inotify-syscalls.h as available e.g. at
  the inotify-cxx homepage.
* GCC 4.x compiler (probably works also with GCC 3.4, possibly with
  older versions too)

  
3. How to use
Include inotify-cxx.h into your sources and add inotify-cxx.cpp for
compiling (e.g. through your makefile).

If you have installed it into your system-wide include dir (e.g.
/usr/include), use #include <inotify-cxx.h> or similar.
Otherwise use #include "inotify-cxx.h".

For thread-safe behavior, define the INOTIFY_THREAD_SAFE symbol
(eg. -DINOTIFY_THREAD_SAFE on gcc's command line). See documentation
for details about thread safety.
